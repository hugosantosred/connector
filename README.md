Odoo Connector Modules
======================

*OpenERP Connector is a powerful framework to develop any kind of bi-directional connector between OpenERP (Open Source ERP) and any other software or service.*

This OpenERP add-on has a modular and generic core, with the ability to be extended with additional modules for new features or customizations.
